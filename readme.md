# Farmhouse Automation

I live in a co-op at school. My housemate Adam and I do various electronics projects.

- `incubator` is an arduino-powered space heater and temperature probe that keeps a cupboard at ~98Â°F. We use it to make bread rise faster, to incubate yogurt, and help with other fermented goods. The space heater is turned on and off with a relay.
